        <h4>Developer. Designer. Forever Learning.</h4>
        <p>
          Hello! On a little more serious note,<br>
          I'm an aspiring full-stack developer named Saryn, currently studying web development and software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m passionate about creating intuitive, interactive, and accessible user experiences.
          I enjoy building small projects to learn new things—whether it’s making buttons grow, tracking clicks, or experimenting with game logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I want to develop games and apps that others enjoy using as much as I enjoy making them.
          Outside of code, I love storytelling like Dungeons and Dragons, strategy games, and finding creative ways to solve problems.

        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
          This site is mostly going to be used as a pseudo-playground/portfolio for myself.<br>
          It's where I’ll keep all my projects, ideas, and just general shenanigans while I learn full-stack development.
